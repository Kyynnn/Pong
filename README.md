# Pong

Pong is a game which is based on Table Tennis.
The only difference is that there is no net between the table.

Rules:

Two players will try to force the ball to the opposite side of the table.

Each time the ball bounces off a racket,
the rackets' and the ball's move speed increases.

Each player must catch the ball with their racket. If the player fails to do so,
the opposing player gains one point.

The first player to get 3 points will win.
